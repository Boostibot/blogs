# About this blog
This is more or less personal documentation of my current technical projects. Its a way for me to give back some of the things I have found to the broader technical community and especially the Handmade comunity. 

# I firmly believe that we ought to spread what we know. 
Before writing any code of my own I pretty much always look for other people's findings. Their code, their considerations, what worked and what didnt. All of these are very valuable to me and to any creative person, because they allow one to start right where the other left off. Stand on the shoulder of all the small giants that came before. Only through constant sharing we prevent others from continously repeating our reseach and mistakes, wasting our limited creative time on pointlessness.

That being said I feel the need to state that reinventing the wheel is good and not what I am talking about. If one wishes to revisit the design decisions of past small giants, one is more then welcome to try. They will certainly learn more intimately about that particular domain and perhaps can challange some already set in ideas.

# Allowing critique
Expsosing others to the reasoning I have done will make its flaws obvious. If you have any corrections or other remarks let me know (via whatever), I will be happy to hear them. In these blogs I will also try to be upfront about the things I know or dont, things I am certain about and directions I havent tried.

# Advertising myslef
Oftentimes these projects are non-visual and non-impressive to the uninitiated. The only way I can change that is by introducing them in the proper context - this blog. The advantages of advertising myself are self explanatory.
